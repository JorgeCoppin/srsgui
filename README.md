# rgagui

This Python application provides a graphic user intrface (GUI) environment 
to a suite of tasks derived from the Task class. 

A user can write a task as a prcedural program without considering interaction with GUI 
and run the task by adding it to a ".taskconfig" configuration file, 
and manage a task suite as a separeate package, without modification of the rgagui core code.

A task uses pre-defined interfaces to interact with **rgagui** for user input, text output, real-time matplotlib plots, 
along with a remote command terminal to an instrument.
