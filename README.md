# rgagui

**rgagui** is a Python application that provides a graphic user interface (GUI) environment 
to manage a suite of tasks. 

A user can write a task as a simple Python script without considering interaction with GUI 
and run the task by adding it to a ".taskconfig" configuration file, 
and manage a task suite as a separate package, without modification of any **rgagui** code.

A task uses pre-defined interfaces to interact with **rgagui** for user input, text output, real-time matplotlib plots, 
along with a remote command terminal to instruments.
